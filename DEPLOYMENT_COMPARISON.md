# Deployment Guide: Netlify vs Railway

## 🚨 **Netlify Issue & Solution**

The error you're seeing is because Netlify is designed for static sites and serverless functions, not traditional Flask web servers. Here are your options:

## 🚀 **Option 1: Railway (RECOMMENDED)**

Railway is perfect for Flask apps and will work much better:

### **Deploy to Railway:**

1. **Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)** and sign up
2. **Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"**
3. **Select your repository**
4. **Railway will automatically detect it's a Python app**
5. **Deploy!**

### **Railway Configuration:**
- ✅ `railway.toml` - Already created
- ✅ `requirements.txt` - Already optimized
- ✅ `Procfile` - Already created
- ✅ Automatic Python detection

### **Railway Benefits:**
- ✅ Perfect for Flask apps
- ✅ Persistent database storage
- ✅ Better for ML applications
- ✅ Automatic HTTPS
- ✅ Custom domains
- ✅ Environment variables support

---

## 🔧 **Option 2: Fix Netlify (Limited Functionality)**

If you want to stick with Netlify, here's what to do:

### **Updated Configuration:**
- ✅ Fixed `runtime.txt` to use `python-3.9`
- ✅ Simplified `netlify.toml`
- ✅ Removed complex build script

### **Netlify Limitations:**
- ⚠️ No persistent database (SQLite won't work)
- ⚠️ No server-side sessions
- ⚠️ Limited to static site + serverless functions
- ⚠️ No ML model support

### **Try Netlify Again:**
1. **Commit the updated files**
2. **Redeploy on Netlify**
3. **It should build successfully now**

## 🌐 **Option 3: Other Platforms**

### **Render (Free Tier Available):**
```bash
# Connect GitHub repo to render.com
# Automatic Python detection
# Free tier available
```

### **Heroku (Paid):**
```bash
# Add Procfile
# Connect GitHub repo
# Deploy with one click
```

### **Google Cloud Run:**
```bash
# Container-based deployment
# Pay-per-use pricing
# Scalable
```
